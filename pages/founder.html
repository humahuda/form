In true sense he was a perfect follower of 12thCentury reformer, Mahatma Basaveshwara. His work was not just confined to Math alone but he also played an active role for liberation of Hyderabad-Karnataka region from Nizam's rule. His contribution towards the existence of Kannada language in this region is unique. During Nizam's regime, displaying Urdu board outside, Swamiji managed to teach Kannada in the Math and Schools providing education to poor children with free food and shelter without any discrimination of caste or creed.</p> 
        
       <p> His vision to educate the people of this backward area led to the formation of SVE Society which grew to the present status with his blessings, encouragement and active patronage. Swamiji was honoured by late Shri Giani Zial Singh, former President of India conferring on him with National Integrity Award. Recognizing his yeomen services, Gulbarga University, Gulbarga conferred on him the Honourary degree of 'Doctor of Literature'.</p>
        
       <p> He was popularly known as "Nadedaduva Devaru" meaning "god who walks" in this region. One is struck at first sight itself by Swamiji's graceful humility and blissfull simplicity of life. On the whole, he was an institution by himself for the cause of humanity.</p>
